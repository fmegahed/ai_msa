The response above was generated starting at 2024-04-22 17:06:57.847507, using the claude-3-opus-20240229 model. The completion was generated with a temperature of 0.0 and a maximum token length of 3000. The code utilized the Langchain module to interact with the model and generate the completions. The Langchain version used was 0.1.14, with two submodules: Langchain-OpenAI (v. 0.1.1) and Langchain-Anthropic version (v. 0.1.6).
