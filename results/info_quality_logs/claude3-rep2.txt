Explanation Section:

1. Accuracy causally increases Trustworthiness (A+): When LLM outputs are more accurate, they are perceived as more trustworthy by users.

2. Accuracy causally increases Objectivity (A+): More accurate LLM outputs are generally seen as more objective and impartial.

3. Trustworthiness is causally increased by Objectivity (B+): When LLM outputs are more objective, they are perceived as more trustworthy.

4. Appropriateness causally increases Relevance (A+): When the volume of information in LLM outputs is appropriate for the task, it is seen as more relevant.

5. Appropriateness causally increases Completeness (A+): Appropriate volume of information in LLM outputs often indicates greater completeness.

6. Appropriateness is causally decreased by Conciseness (B−): More concise LLM outputs may be seen as less appropriate in terms of information volume.

7. Appropriateness causally increases Understandability (A+): LLM outputs with an appropriate volume of information are generally easier to understand.

8. Appropriateness causally increases Interpretability (A+): Appropriate volume of information in LLM outputs enhances interpretability.

9. Appropriateness causally increases Flexibility (A+): LLM outputs with an appropriate volume of information are often more flexible in their application.

10. Relevance causally increases Understandability (A+): More relevant LLM outputs are generally easier to understand.

11. Relevance causally increases Interpretability (A+): Relevant LLM outputs are often more interpretable.

12. Relevance causally increases Flexibility (A+): Relevant LLM outputs are generally more flexible in their application.

13. Completeness is causally decreased by Conciseness (B−): More concise LLM outputs may be seen as less complete in terms of information breadth and depth.

14. Completeness causally increases Understandability (A+): More complete LLM outputs are generally easier to understand.

15. Completeness causally increases Interpretability (A+): Complete LLM outputs are often more interpretable.

16. Completeness causally increases Flexibility (A+): Complete LLM outputs are generally more flexible in their application.

17. Conciseness causally increases Understandability (A+): More concise LLM outputs are generally easier to understand.

18. Conciseness causally increases Interpretability (A+): Concise LLM outputs are often more interpretable.

19. Conciseness causally increases Flexibility (A+): Concise LLM outputs are generally more flexible in their application.

20. Consistency causally increases Understandability (A+): Consistent presentation of information in LLM outputs enhances understandability.

21. Consistency causally increases Interpretability (A+): Consistent presentation of information in LLM outputs improves interpretability.

22. Consistency causally increases Flexibility (A+): Consistent presentation of information in LLM outputs often leads to greater flexibility in application.

23. Understandability causally increases Interpretability (A+): More understandable LLM outputs are generally more interpretable.

24. Understandability causally increases Flexibility (A+): Understandable LLM outputs are often more flexible in their application.

25. Interpretability causally increases Flexibility (A+): More interpretable LLM outputs are generally more flexible in their application.

26. Accuracy, Trustworthiness, Objectivity, Appropriateness, Relevance, Completeness, Conciseness, Consistency, Understandability, Interpretability, and Flexibility all causally increase Satisfaction (A+): Improvements in these dimensions generally lead to higher user satisfaction with LLM outputs.

27. Accuracy, Trustworthiness, Objectivity, Appropriateness, Relevance, Completeness, Conciseness, Consistency, Understandability, Interpretability, Flexibility, and Satisfaction all causally increase Use Intention (A+): Improvements in these dimensions and higher satisfaction generally lead to greater intention to use LLM outputs in the future.
