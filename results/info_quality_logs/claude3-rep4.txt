Explanation Section:
1. Accuracy causally increases Trustworthiness (A+): As the accuracy of LLM outputs increases, users are more likely to trust the information provided.
2. Accuracy causally increases Satisfaction (A+) and Use Intention (A+): When LLM outputs are more accurate, users are more satisfied with the results and more likely to use the model in the future.
3. Trustworthiness is causally increased by Objectivity (B+): When LLM outputs are more objective and unbiased, users are more likely to trust the information.
4. Objectivity causally increases Satisfaction (A+) and Use Intention (A+): As LLM outputs become more objective, users are more satisfied and more likely to use the model in the future.
5. Appropriateness is causally increased by Relevance (B+), Completeness (B+), and causally decreased by Conciseness (B−): The appropriateness of LLM outputs is influenced by the relevance and completeness of the information, while conciseness may decrease appropriateness if too much information is omitted.
6. Appropriateness causally increases Understandability (B+), Interpretability (B+), Flexibility (B+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+): When LLM outputs are more appropriate for the task at hand, they are easier to understand, interpret, and apply to different tasks, leading to higher user satisfaction and future use intention.
7. Relevance, Completeness, Conciseness, and Consistency causally increase Understandability (B+), Interpretability (B+), Flexibility (B+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+): These dimensions contribute to the ease of understanding, interpreting, and applying LLM outputs to various tasks, resulting in higher user satisfaction and future use intention.
8. Understandability and Interpretability causally increase Flexibility (B+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+): When LLM outputs are easier to understand and interpret, they are more flexible in their application, leading to higher user satisfaction and future use intention.
9. Flexibility causally increases Satisfaction (A+) and Use Intention (A+): As LLM outputs become more flexible and easy to manipulate for different tasks, user satisfaction and future use intention increase.
10. Satisfaction causally increases Use Intention (A+): When users are more satisfied with LLM outputs, they are more likely to use the model in the future.
