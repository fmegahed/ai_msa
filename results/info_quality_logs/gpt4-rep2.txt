**Explanation Section:**

- **Accuracy to Trustworthiness (0):** There's no direct causal increase or decrease in trustworthiness based on accuracy alone, as trustworthiness also depends on other factors like source credibility.
- **Accuracy to Objectivity (A+):** More accurate information tends to be seen as more objective because it aligns better with factual and unbiased representations.
- **Accuracy to Completeness (A+):** Accurate information often includes comprehensive details, contributing to the completeness of the information.
- **Trustworthiness to Objectivity (A+):** Information deemed trustworthy is often perceived as more objective, as trust implies a lack of bias.
- **Trustworthiness to Understandability (A+), Interpretability (A+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+):** Trust in the information increases its comprehensibility, interpretability, user satisfaction, and the likelihood of future use, as users are more inclined to engage with content they trust.
- **Appropriateness to Relevance (A+), Completeness (A+), Conciseness (A−), Understandability (A+), Interpretability (A+), Flexibility (A+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+):** Appropriateness ensures information volume is suitable, enhancing relevance, completeness, and user satisfaction while potentially reducing conciseness. It makes information more understandable, interpretable, flexible for various uses, and likely to be used again.
- **Relevance to Completeness (A+), Understandability (A+), Interpretability (A+), Flexibility (A+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+):** Relevant information is more likely to be complete, understandable, interpretable, applicable in different contexts, satisfying, and reused.
- **Completeness to Conciseness (A−), Understandability (A+), Interpretability (A+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+):** While completeness enriches information, it may reduce conciseness. However, it increases understandability, interpretability, satisfaction, and the likelihood of future use.
- **Conciseness to Consistency (A−), Understandability (A+), Interpretability (A+), Flexibility (A+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+):** Conciseness might reduce consistency due to varied summarization levels but enhances understandability, interpretability, flexibility, satisfaction, and future use intention by eliminating unnecessary details.
- **Understandability to Interpretability (A+), Flexibility (A+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+):** Understandable information is easier to interpret, apply in various contexts, leads to higher satisfaction, and increases the likelihood of future use.
- **Interpretability to Flexibility (A+), Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+):** Clear definitions and use of appropriate symbols or languages enhance the flexibility of information application, user satisfaction, and the intention to use the information again.
- **Flexibility to Satisfaction (A+), and Use Intention (A+):** The ease of manipulating and applying information to different tasks increases user satisfaction and the likelihood of future use.
- **Satisfaction to Use Intention (A+):** Higher satisfaction with the information leads to a greater intention to use it in future tasks.
