**Explanation Section:**

- **Accuracy to Trustworthiness**: Increased accuracy in LLM outputs leads to higher trustworthiness because users are more likely to trust information that is correct and reliable.
- **Trustworthiness to Accuracy**: There's no direct causal increase or decrease in accuracy based on trustworthiness; trustworthiness is a perception that can be influenced by accuracy but does not inherently change the factual correctness of the information.
- **Objectivity to Accuracy and Trustworthiness**: Objectivity enhances both accuracy and trustworthiness because unbiased and impartial information is more likely to be correct and trusted by users.
- **Appropriateness**: There are no direct causal relationships from appropriateness to other constructs in this context, as it primarily concerns the volume of information rather than its qualitative attributes.
- **Relevance to Appropriateness and Understandability**: Relevant information is more likely to be seen as appropriate for the task at hand and easier to understand because it aligns with the user's needs and context.
- **Completeness to Accuracy, Trustworthiness, and Relevance**: More complete information can enhance accuracy (by covering all necessary aspects), trustworthiness (by providing a comprehensive view), and relevance (by ensuring all pertinent information is included).
- **Conciseness to Completeness**: There is a negative causal relationship here; more concise information may reduce completeness by omitting details to achieve brevity.
- **Consistency**: No direct causal relationships were identified from consistency to other constructs, as it primarily concerns the format rather than the qualitative content of information.
- **Understandability to Relevance and Consistency**: Information that is easier to understand is more likely to be relevant to the user's needs and presented consistently to aid comprehension.
- **Interpretability to Relevance and Understandability**: Clear definitions and appropriate symbols or languages make information more relevant and easier to understand by ensuring that the user can interpret it correctly.
- **Flexibility to Appropriateness and Relevance**: Flexible information can be more easily adapted to different tasks, making it more appropriate and relevant to various contexts.
- **Satisfaction to Trustworthiness, Relevance, and Understandability**: Satisfaction is increased by trustworthiness (users are satisfied when they can trust the information), relevance (information that meets the user's needs is more satisfying), and understandability (information that is easy to comprehend is more satisfying).
- **Use Intention to Trustworthiness and Relevance**: The intention to use information in the future is increased by its trustworthiness (users are more likely to use information they trust) and relevance (information that is relevant to the user's needs is more likely to be used again).
